Introduction posts can wait, but a ten-year anniversary only comes once in a decade. And what better way to kick off your blog than to wish Git a very Happy Birthday? (No, don't even try suggesting better ways!). But why? Because, for one thing, *Git* is what has made this website possible. I am very thankful to Linus Torvalds for creating something that has improved our lives as coders and maintainers.

I will admit that my first experience with Git was very frustrating. I was coding a [super simple website](http://www.supplyzone.in/ "SupplyZone") with a friend and we got stuck in a myriad of merge conflicts. They were so devastating that we ended up manually copying pasting the code and, as a result, had four Github repositories by the time we finished. Our mistake was that we went *pro* before even trying out Git on our own. 

But I was assured that all this fuss about VCSs in general, and Git in specific, could not be for nothing. So I used it again the next time I started a project and got hooked. Other than it being perfect as a distributed version control system, a `git commit` is mentally very satisfying, getting closer to project completion, *one commit at a time*. Sometimes when I feel hopeless, `git log` tells me, "*Come on, you did all that, this new thing can't be impossible!*". You get addicted to this `(git) push`.

Now how is it responsible for this website? Because the site is hosted on Github Pages, and each post is a new commit and push (More about it on later, perhaps!).

So thank you Git, and a very Happy Birthday.
