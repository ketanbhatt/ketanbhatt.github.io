I am a newbie in the field of web development, and trying to learn a lot and grasp a lot the right way.

I am presently working as an intern with Pyoopil, a start-up working towards solving the problem of providing skill development opportunity to masses.

I am also pursuing Engineering in Computer Sciences, and I write occasionally when the mood strikes.
